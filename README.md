## Learnt

 - The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex.
 - <strong>flex-direction</strong>
 - The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
 - <strong>justify-content</strong>
       - The center value aligns the flex items at the center of the container.
 -  <strong>align-items</strong>
      - the align-items property is used to align the flex items.Vertically aligns the flex items when the items do not use all available space on the cross-axis<br />
      - The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the bottom of the container<br /> 
- The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.Modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex items, it aligns flex lines.<br />
